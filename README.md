# BookDetails:blush:
In this project I am using RecyclerView which is the extension of listview to display the details of the books:smiley:
By default the flowers details will be displayed:thumbsup:.
It is useful to know about the main content of the book:green_book: before reading
It displays the details like image of the book, Title of the book and author of the book.
Uses Picasso:point_left: to load the Images which is the most Popular and useful third party library and it takes care of Image loading into our project:relaxed:
